    <h2>Description: </h2>
        <p>Parotta is a delicious, flaky, layered South Indian flatbread renowned for its unique texture—it is crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. This sought-after street food staple is often described as rich, comforting, and incredibly satisfying. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: 2 cups All-purpose flour (Maida)</li>
            <li>Sweetener: 2 tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt: ½ tsp or to taste</li>
            <li>Liquid: ¼ cup Milk or warm water (or a mix)</li>
            <li>Fat: 2 tbsp Oil (for dough) + more for coating/cooking</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 Egg, Baking Powder (for extra softness) </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Form Dough: Add milk/water and 2 tbsp oil, mix to form a soft, slightly sticky dough. Knead for 10-15 mins until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>First Rest: Coat with oil, cover with a damp cloth, and rest for 30-60 mins.</li>
            <li>Ball Up: Knead again briefly, divide into 8 equal balls, coat with oil, and rest for another 20-30 mins.</li>
            <li>Stretch & Pleat (The Key):
                <ol>
                    <li>On an oiled surface, roll or stretch a dough ball very thin, almost transparent.</li>
                    <li>Apply oil and gather the thin sheet by pleating it lengthwise like a saree.</li>
                    <li>Twist the pleated strip into a spiral, tucking the end underneath.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Second Roll: Rest the spiral for 5 mins, then gently flatten and roll it into a 7-8 inch disc.</li>
            <li>Cook: Heat a tawa (griddle) on medium flame. Cook the parotta, flipping and applying oil on both sides until golden brown spots appear.</li>
            <li>Fluff: Remove and immediately press/beat the hot parotta on both sides to open the layers. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
